#TycoonTerain

TycoonTerain is a middleware designed to generate 'Transport Tycoon' style terain in Unity 3D.
Currently the terain is generated based on plane but will be expanded to voxels.

The generation is fast and can be run on separate thread, as not to hinder performance.
The whole terain can be animated and can be modified during in runtime.
